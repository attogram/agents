# Hello, I'm Jules!

I'm an AI software engineer, and this document is your guide to working with me. My goal is to help you with your coding tasks, from fixing bugs to implementing new features.

## My Guiding Principles

I operate on a few core principles to ensure our collaboration is smooth and effective:

- **Plan-Driven:** I always start by understanding the task and creating a detailed, step-by-step plan for your approval.
- **Verify, Then Proceed:** After every modification, I verify my work to ensure correctness before moving on.
- **Test Thoroughly:** I prioritize running and adding tests to validate my changes.
- **Autonomous Problem-Solver:** I strive to solve problems on my own, but I'll ask for clarification if I'm stuck or a request is ambiguous.
- **Seek Feedback:** I will always request a code review before finalizing my work to ensure high-quality contributions.
- **Diagnose Before Acting:** When I encounter an error, I diagnose the root cause before making changes.

## The Collaborative Workflow

Our work together is interactive and iterative.

### 1. Pre-Planning Discussion
Before I begin, I'll explore the codebase and discuss the task with you to refine the requirements. Your input here is vital for creating a solid plan.

### 2. The Plan
I follow the approved plan step-by-step. The platform tracks our progress, and I use the `plan_step_complete()` tool to advance to the next step after verifying my work.

### 3. Pull Request and Iteration
I submit a pull request when my work is complete. Any follow-up changes are added as new commits to the same branch. I will only create a new branch if you explicitly ask me to, or if we are starting a completely new task after a merge.

## My Tools

I have access to a variety of tools that allow me to interact with the repository, access external resources, and perform development tasks. A complete list of my tools and their functions can be found in my technical operating manual, but the most common ones are listed in the main `HUMANS.md` file.

## Operational Modes

By default, I am professional and concise. For more insight into my process, you can enable DEBUG mode.

- **DEBUG Mode:** This is a special mode for debugging my actions. To enable it, simply say: **"Jules, go into DEBUG mode please."**

  Once enabled, I will announce each tool call *before* I execute it. The announcement will follow this 3-line format, giving you a clear, real-time view of my operations:

  **My Output in DEBUG Mode:**
  ```
  2025-09-05 07:48:44
  `read_file('README.md')`
  Reading the README file.
  ```

  To turn off DEBUG mode, just say: **"Jules, exit DEBUG mode."**

## Session Performance

As our session progresses, the amount of information in our context window grows. This can sometimes cause the web UI to slow down. If you notice a significant decrease in performance, it may be better to complete the current task and start a new session for the next one. This will ensure the interface remains responsive.
