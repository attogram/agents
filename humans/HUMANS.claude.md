## About Claude

Claude is an AI assistant created by Anthropic. This iteration is Claude Sonnet 4 from the Claude 4 model family, designed to be a smart, efficient model for everyday use. Claude is accessible through web-based, mobile, and desktop chat interfaces.

## Core Capabilities

Claude excels at a wide variety of tasks including:

- **Analysis & Research**: Breaking down complex problems, analyzing documents, and synthesizing information
- **Writing & Communication**: Creating content, editing text, drafting emails, and improving clarity
- **Reasoning & Problem-Solving**: Working through logical problems, providing step-by-step explanations
- **Creative Tasks**: Writing stories, brainstorming ideas, and creative problem-solving
- **Learning & Teaching**: Explaining concepts clearly with examples and analogies
- **Code & Technical Tasks**: Writing, debugging, and explaining code in various programming languages

## Communication Best Practices

### Be Clear and Specific

- Provide clear context and specific requirements
- Include relevant background information
- Specify your desired format, length, or style when applicable

### Use Examples

- Provide positive examples of what you want
- Include negative examples of what to avoid when helpful
- Show Claude the pattern you're looking for

### Request Step-by-Step Reasoning

- Ask Claude to "think step by step" for complex problems
- Request explanations of reasoning when needed
- Ask for clarification of any unclear steps

### Specify Output Format

- Request specific XML tags, markdown formatting, or structure when needed
- Specify if you want bullet points, numbered lists, or prose
- Indicate desired length (brief, detailed, comprehensive)

- Request comparisons between multiple documents
- Have Claude check for errors, inconsistencies, or missing information

## Creative Collaboration

### Writing Projects

- Provide genre, tone, and style preferences
- Share target audience information
- Specify length and format requirements
- Ask for multiple versions or iterations

### Brainstorming

- Start with broad topics and narrow down
- Ask Claude to build on your ideas
- Request different perspectives or approaches
- Combine and refine ideas iteratively

## Technical Tasks

### Code Assistance

- Specify programming language and framework
- Provide context about your project and goals
- Include relevant code snippets or error messages
- Ask for explanations of complex concepts

### Problem-Solving

- Break down complex problems into smaller parts
- Ask for multiple solution approaches
- Request pros and cons of different options
- Iterate on solutions based on feedback

## Research and Analysis

### Information Gathering

- Be specific about what type of information you need
- Ask Claude to search for recent information when needed
- Request source verification for important claims
- Ask for different perspectives on controversial topics

### Critical Analysis

- Ask Claude to evaluate arguments, evidence, and sources
- Request identification of biases, assumptions, or gaps
- Have Claude compare different viewpoints
- Ask for balanced assessments of complex issues

## Conversation Management

### Session Continuity

- Reference previous parts of the conversation when building on earlier topics
- Remind Claude of important context if the conversation is long
- Ask Claude to summarize key points from earlier in the discussion

### Error Correction

- Politely correct any mistakes Claude makes
- Provide clarification if Claude misunderstands your request
- Ask follow-up questions if responses aren't quite right

### Feedback and Iteration

- Provide specific feedback on Claude's responses
- Ask for revisions with specific changes
- Build on partial solutions iteratively
- Use the thumbs up/down buttons to provide feedback to Anthropic

## Understanding Claude's Limitations

### Knowledge Cutoff

- Claude's training data has a cutoff at the end of January 2025
- For current events or recent developments, Claude will use web search when appropriate
- Ask Claude to search for recent information when needed

### Capabilities

- Claude cannot browse the internet independently (except through search)
- Claude cannot remember conversations between separate chat sessions
- Claude cannot perform actions outside the chat interface
- Claude cannot access external systems, databases, or APIs

### Accuracy and Verification

- Always verify important information, especially for critical decisions
- Ask Claude to explain its reasoning for important conclusions
- Cross-check information from multiple sources when accuracy is crucial
- Be aware that Claude can make mistakes and should not be the sole source for critical information

## Privacy and Safety

### Information Sharing

- Be mindful of sensitive personal information in conversations
- Remember that conversations may be used to improve AI systems
- Don't share passwords, financial information, or other sensitive data

### Content Guidelines

- Claude is designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest
- It won't assist with illegal activities, harmful content, or deceptive practices
- If Claude declines a request, consider rephrasing or providing more context

## Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Engineering

- Use role-playing: "Act as a [expert/teacher/critic] and..."
- Chain of thought: "Let's work through this step by step..."
- Multiple perspectives: "Consider this from the viewpoint of..."
- Structured output: "Organize your response with clear headings..."

### Complex Tasks

- Break large projects into smaller, manageable pieces
- Create templates or frameworks for repeated tasks
- Use Claude to help plan and organize complex work
- Iterate and refine outputs through multiple rounds

## Getting Better Results

### Effective Questioning

- Ask open-ended questions for broader exploration
- Use specific questions for targeted information
- Follow up with clarifying questions
- Build on previous answers to go deeper

### Collaboration Strategies

- Treat Claude as a thinking partner, not just a tool
- Engage in back-and-forth dialogue
- Challenge ideas and ask for alternatives
- Use Claude to check your own thinking

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude Isn't Understanding

- Provide more specific context and examples
- Break down complex requests into smaller parts
- Rephrase your question in different ways
- Ask Claude what additional information would be helpful

### If Results Aren't What You Expected

- Provide specific feedback on what needs to change
- Ask for alternative approaches or perspectives
- Clarify your goals and requirements
- Try a different angle or approach to the problem
