# Claude Code - AI Coding Assistant

This document provides guidance for humans collaborating with Claude through Claude Code, Anthropic's command line tool for agentic coding.

## About Claude Code

Claude Code is a command line tool that lets developers delegate coding tasks to Claude directly from their terminal. It provides a specialized interface for development work, allowing Claude to interact with your codebase, run commands, and make changes autonomously.

## Getting Started

### Installation and Setup
Check the official documentation at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code for installation instructions and setup requirements.

### Basic Usage
Claude Code allows you to describe coding tasks in natural language and have Claude execute them with access to your development environment.

## Core Capabilities

### Codebase Management
- **File Operations**: Creating, reading, modifying, and organizing code files
- **Code Analysis**: Understanding existing codebases and identifying patterns
- **Refactoring**: Restructuring code while maintaining functionality
- **Documentation**: Generating and updating code documentation

### Development Tasks
- **Feature Implementation**: Building new functionality from requirements
- **Bug Fixing**: Identifying and resolving issues in existing code
- **Testing**: Writing and running tests, debugging test failures
- **Code Review**: Analyzing code quality and suggesting improvements

### Environment Integration
- **Command Execution**: Running build scripts, tests, and other development commands
- **Package Management**: Installing dependencies and managing project requirements
- **Version Control**: Working with Git repositories and managing changes

## Best Practices for Task Delegation

### Define Clear Objectives
- Specify exactly what you want accomplished
- Include acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Provide context about the broader project goals
- Mention any constraints or requirements

### Provide Sufficient Context
- Share relevant background about the codebase
- Explain the purpose and scope of existing functionality
- Include information about coding standards and conventions
- Mention any architectural decisions or patterns to follow

### Set Boundaries and Expectations
- Specify which files or directories Claude should focus on
- Indicate any files that should not be modified
- Set expectations for testing and validation
- Clarify whether to implement quick fixes or robust solutions

## Effective Collaboration Patterns

### Start Small and Iterate
- Begin with well-defined, smaller tasks
- Review results before moving to more complex work
- Build complexity gradually as Claude learns your codebase
- Use feedback to refine subsequent tasks

### Leverage Claude's Analysis
- Ask Claude to explore and understand your codebase first
- Request architectural analysis and recommendations
- Have Claude identify potential issues or improvements
- Use Claude's insights to inform development decisions

### Maintain Development Standards
- Ensure Claude follows your coding conventions
- Request adherence to existing patterns and architectures
- Ask for proper error handling and edge case consideration
- Verify that changes include appropriate tests

## Working with Different Types of Projects

### New Projects
- Have Claude help with project structure and scaffolding
- Ask for best practice recommendations for your technology stack
- Request creation of foundational components and utilities
- Use Claude to establish testing and documentation frameworks

### Existing Codebases
- Start with exploration and analysis tasks
- Request documentation of existing functionality
- Ask Claude to identify areas for improvement or refactoring
- Have Claude work on isolated components before core functionality

### Legacy Systems
- Ask Claude to analyze and document legacy code
- Request modernization recommendations
- Have Claude create tests for existing functionality
- Use Claude to gradually refactor problematic areas

## Code Quality and Review

### Automated Testing
- Ask Claude to write comprehensive test suites
- Request both unit tests and integration tests
- Have Claude run tests and fix any failures
- Ensure new features include appropriate test coverage

### Code Review Process
- Request Claude to review its own changes before submission
- Ask for explanations of significant architectural decisions
- Have Claude check for potential security vulnerabilities
- Request performance considerations for critical code paths

### Documentation Standards
- Ask Claude to document complex algorithms and business logic
- Request inline comments for non-obvious code
- Have Claude update README files and API documentation
- Ensure new features include usage examples

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Multi-Step Projects
- Break complex projects into phases or milestones
- Use Claude to create project plans and task breakdowns
- Have Claude estimate effort and identify dependencies
- Review and approve each phase before proceeding

### Research and Exploration
- Ask Claude to research best practices for your use case
- Request comparison of different implementation approaches
- Have Claude prototype and evaluate different solutions
- Use Claude to investigate new technologies or frameworks

### Debugging and Troubleshooting
- Provide error messages and stack traces for analysis
- Ask Claude to investigate intermittent issues
- Request systematic debugging approaches
- Have Claude create minimal reproducible examples

## Security and Safety Considerations

### Code Security
- Ask Claude to review code for security vulnerabilities
- Request input validation and sanitization checks
- Have Claude verify proper authentication and authorization
- Ensure sensitive data handling follows best practices

### Access Control
- Be mindful of what parts of your codebase Claude can access
- Consider using separate development environments
- Avoid exposing sensitive configuration or credentials
- Review changes before deploying to production environments

### Backup and Version Control
- Ensure all changes are properly committed to version control
- Create branches for experimental work
- Regularly backup important work
- Use meaningful commit messages describing Claude's changes

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Task Definition
- Provide clear, specific requirements to minimize back-and-forth
- Include all necessary context upfront
- Use precise technical terminology when appropriate
- Reference specific files, functions, or components when relevant

### Codebase Navigation
- Help Claude understand your project structure
- Point out key files and important architectural decisions
- Explain naming conventions and organizational patterns
- Identify critical paths and high-impact areas

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### When Claude Doesn't Understand Your Codebase
- Provide more context about the project's purpose and architecture
- Explain domain-specific concepts and business logic
- Point out key design patterns and conventions used
- Share relevant documentation or specifications

### When Results Don't Meet Expectations
- Provide specific feedback on what needs to be changed
- Clarify requirements that may have been ambiguous
- Ask Claude to explain its approach and reasoning
- Request alternative implementations if needed

### When Integration Issues Arise
- Check that Claude understands your development environment
- Verify that all dependencies and tools are properly configured
- Ensure Claude is following your team's development workflow
- Address any conflicts with existing code or standards

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning from Experience
- Keep track of what works well with Claude
- Note patterns in successful task descriptions
- Identify areas where additional context helps
- Refine your collaboration approach over time

### Feedback and Iteration
- Provide regular feedback on Claude's work quality
- Suggest improvements to development processes
- Ask Claude to learn from previous mistakes
- Continuously refine task delegation strategies
