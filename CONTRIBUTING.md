# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. We welcome contributions of all kinds, from documentation improvements to new ideas for structuring AI-human collaboration.

## Getting Started

If you have an idea for a change, please first open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to align on the approach before you invest time in a pull request.

When making changes, please ensure you follow the core principles of this repository:
- **Show, Don't Tell:** Keep documentation factual, concise, and to the point.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Ensure information is defined once and linked to from other documents.

## Working with AI Agents

This repository is designed to be maintained by both humans and AI agents. For a detailed guide on how this collaboration works, please review the following documents:

- **[HUMANS.md](./HUMANS.md):** Provides guidance for humans on how to work with the AI agents in this repository.
- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md):** Provides instructions for the AI agents themselves.

If your contribution involves changing how AI agents should behave or interact with the codebase, you may need to update the relevant files in the `agents/` or `platforms/` directories.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any new documentation or changes follow the principles outlined above.
2.  Update the documentation to reflect your changes. This includes keeping the interlinking between documents consistent.
3.  Submit your pull request and provide a clear description of the changes you have made.
