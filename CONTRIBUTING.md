# Contributing to Agents

First off, thank you for considering contributing! We're excited you're here. This project aims to create a clear, effective standard for instructing external AI assistants, and we welcome your help.

## What is this project about?

This repository provides a simple `AGENTS.md` file. Its purpose is to give clear instructions to external AI helpers (like coding assistants) working on projects that don't have their own internal AI systems. It's all about making human-AI collaboration on codebases smoother and more effective.

## Why should you contribute?

By contributing, you can:
-   **Improve the standard:** Help refine the wording of the `AGENTS.md` to be even clearer for AI assistants.
-   **Shape a new best practice:** The way we interact with AI on code is new. Your ideas can help establish a useful convention.
-   **Suggest new ideas:** Have an idea for a different kind of `AGENTS.md` file for a different type of project? We'd love to hear it!

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from simple typo fixes to new file suggestions.

1.  **Find something to improve:** Look for unclear wording in `AGENTS.md` or the `README.md`, or think about a new kind of template that could be useful.
2.  **Open an issue (optional):** If you want to discuss a change, feel free to open an issue first.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request:**
    -   Fork the repository.
    -   Create a new branch for your changes.
    -   Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
    -   Open a pull request and describe the change you've made.

We appreciate every contribution. Thank you for helping make this project better!
