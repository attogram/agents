# Contributing to Agents

First off, thank you for considering contributing! We're excited you're here. This project aims to create a collection of clear, effective templates for instructing external AI assistants, and we welcome your help.

## What is this project about?

This repository provides a set of `AGENTS.md` templates. Their purpose is to give clear, technology-specific instructions to external AI helpers (like coding assistants). It's all about making human-AI collaboration on codebases smoother and more effective.

## Why should you contribute?

By contributing, you can:

- **Improve the templates:** Help refine the wording of the `AGENTS.md` templates to be even clearer for AI assistants.
- **Shape a new best practice:** The way we interact with AI on code is new. Your ideas can help establish useful conventions.
- **Suggest new templates:** Have an idea for a new `AGENTS.md` file for a different type of project or technology? We'd love to hear it!

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from simple typo fixes to new file suggestions.

1.  **Find something to improve:** Look for unclear wording in the `AGENTS.md` templates or the `README.md`, or think about a new kind of template that could be useful.
2.  **Open an issue (optional):** If you want to discuss a change, feel free to open an issue first.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request:**
    - Fork the repository.
    - Create a new branch for your changes.
    - Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
    - Open a pull request and describe the change you've made.

We appreciate every contribution. Thank you for helping make this project better!
