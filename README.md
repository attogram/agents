# AI Agent Documentation

This repository provides a sample documentation structure designed for projects that collaborate with AI agents. The goal is to create a clear, maintainable, and scalable system that separates instructions for AI agents from guidance for human contributors.

This approach is guided by two principles:
1.  **Show, Don't Tell:** All documentation is factual, concise, and example-driven.
2.  **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** All documents are interlinked to create a single source of truth.

## How It Works

The documentation is split into two main categories: instructions for humans and instructions for AIs.

-   **[HUMANS.md](./HUMANS.md):** The primary entry point for human collaborators. It explains how to work effectively with the AI agents involved in this project.
-   **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md):** The primary entry point for AI agents. It provides instructions and context for the AI, including pointers to persona- and platform-specific guidelines.

## Directory Structure

The documentation is organized into the following directories:

-   `./humans/`: Contains guides for humans on how to interact with specific AI agent personas.
-   `./agents/`: Contains technical instructions for specific AI agent personas.
-   `./platforms/`: Contains technical instructions for how agents should work with specific technologies (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, tools).
