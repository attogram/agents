# Agents

> Instructions for AI assistants.

Use this `AGENTS.md` file to manage external AI coding assistants. Define your project's rules and structure for effective AI collaboration.

## The `AGENTS.md` Philosophy

An `AGENTS.md` file serves as a set of instructions for an *external* AI helper, like a coding assistant you might use in your IDE or a chatbot. Think of it as a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, but written for a temporary, external AI collaborator. It sets the rules of engagement, defines the project's boundaries, and clarifies how the AI can be most helpful without overstepping.

The primary goal is to leverage AI assistance for development tasks (like debugging, refactoring, or documentation) on projects that **do not contain their own internal AI systems.**

It is **not** for defining internal, autonomous AI agents that are part of a system's architecture.

## How to Use

1.  Review the `AGENTS.md` file in this repository.
2.  Copy the file into the root of your repository.
3.  Customize it with specific details about your project (e.g., build commands, test scripts, coding standards).

## Included Boilerplate

*   [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md): A template for projects that do **not** have internal AI capabilities and want to set clear boundaries for external AI helpers. It establishes a philosophy of supportive, non-transformative assistance.
