## Guiding Philosophy

- **AI as a Partner:** Treat AI agents as junior developers. Provide clear instructions and review their work.
- **Clear Communication:** Specific, actionable requests produce better outcomes.
- **Iterative Workflow:** Use an iterative Pull Request process. Provide feedback to guide the AI toward the desired solution.

## How It Works

AI agents are guided by instruction files.

- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md):** The base instruction file for all AI agents.
  This file sets the technical standards for the AI's work.
- The `humans/` directory contains guides on how to work with specific AI agent personas.

## Your Role as a Collaborator

1.  **Define Tasks:** Create clear, well-defined tasks for the AI.
2.  **Provide Context:** Give the AI the necessary context and information to succeed.
3.  **Review Work:** Carefully review all AI-submitted pull requests for accuracy and quality.
4.  **Provide Feedback:** Give specific, constructive feedback to guide the AI's revisions.
