# Working with AI Agents

This document provides guidance for humans working with AI agents in this repository.

## Guiding Philosophy

- **AI as a Partner:** Treat AI agents as junior developers. Provide clear instructions and review their work.
- **Clear Communication:** Specific requests produce better outcomes.
- **Iterative Workflow:** Use an iterative PR process. Provide feedback to guide the AI.

## How It Works

AI agents are guided by instruction documents.

- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md):** The master instruction file for all AI agents.
- **Personas (`./humans/`):** See documents in this directory for guides on specific AI personas.

2.  **Provide Context:** Give the AI necessary information.
3.  **Review Work:** Carefully review AI-submitted pull requests.
4.  **Provide Feedback:** Give specific, constructive feedback.
