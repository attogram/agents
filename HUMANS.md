# Working with AI Agents

This document provides guidance for human collaborators on how to work effectively with the AI agents in this repository. Our goal is a seamless partnership between human and artificial intelligence.

## Guiding Philosophy

Our collaboration is built on a few key ideas:
- **AI as a Partner:** Treat the AI agents as junior developers. Provide clear instructions, but expect to review their work.
- **Clear Communication:** The more specific your request, the better the outcome will be.
- **Iterative Workflow:** We use an iterative process. An AI agent will submit a pull request, and you can provide feedback to guide it to the final solution.

## How It Works

The AI agents in this repository are guided by a set of instruction documents. You can review these to understand how they work:
- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md):** The master instruction file for all AI agents.
- **Personas (`./humans/`):** For detailed guides on how to interact with specific AI personas, see the documents in this directory.

## Your Role

Your role is to:
1.  **Define Tasks:** Create clear, actionable tasks for the AI agents.
2.  **Provide Context:** Give the AI the information it needs to succeed.
3.  **Review Work:** Carefully review pull requests submitted by AI agents.
4.  **Provide Feedback:** Give specific, constructive feedback to guide the AI's revisions.

By following these guidelines, we can create a highly productive and collaborative environment.
