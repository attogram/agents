# AI Assistant Guidelines for Laravel Projects

This document provides a detailed guide for working on this Laravel project. It covers the project structure, key concepts, and common development workflows. For more in-depth information, always refer to the [official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).

## 1. Core Architectural Concepts

Before diving into the code, it's important to understand some of Laravel's core architectural concepts.

-   **Service Container & Service Providers:** The service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection. Service providers are the central place to configure your application, binding services, registering event listeners, and more. You'll find them in `app/Providers`.
-   **Facades:** Facades provide a static-like interface to services that are available in the application's service container. They offer a terse, expressive syntax while remaining testable.
-   **Request Lifecycle:** All requests are handled by the `public/index.php` file. From there, the request is sent through the kernel (`app/Http/Kernel.php`), which processes a series of middleware before dispatching the request to a controller or route closure.
-   **Eloquent ORM:** Laravel's default Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is Eloquent. It provides a beautiful, simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that table. Models are located in the `app/Models` directory.
-   **Blade Templating Engine:** Blade is Laravel's powerful templating engine. Blade view files use the `.blade.php` extension and are stored in the `resources/views` directory.
-   **Artisan Console:** Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application. You can view a list of all available commands using `php artisan list`.

## 2. Directory Structure Overview

A typical Laravel application's directory structure is designed to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications.

-   `app/`: Contains the core code of your application.
    -   `Http/Controllers`: Handles incoming HTTP requests.
    -   `Http/Middleware`: Filters HTTP requests entering your application.
    -   `Models`: Contains all of your Eloquent model classes.
    -   `Providers`: Houses the service providers for your application.
    -   Other directories like `Console`, `Events`, `Jobs`, `Listeners`, `Mail`, `Notifications`, `Policies`, and `Rules` are often generated by Artisan commands.
-   `bootstrap/`: Contains files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading.
-   `config/`: Contains all of the application's configuration files.
-   `database/`: Contains database migrations, model factories, and seeders.
    -   `migrations/`: Database schema definitions.
    -   `seeders/`: Classes to populate the database with test data.
    -   `factories/`: Define blueprints for creating model instances.
-   `public/`: The web server's document root. Contains the `index.php` entry point and public assets (images, compiled CSS/JS).
-   `resources/`: Contains your views, raw assets (like JS and SASS files), and language files.
    -   `views/`: Blade templates.
    -   `js/`, `css/`, `sass/`: Frontend assets before compilation.
-   `routes/`: Contains all route definitions.
    -   `web.php`: Routes for the web interface (session, CSRF, etc.).
    -   `api.php`: Stateless routes for your API.
    -   `console.php`: Console commands.
-   `storage/`: Contains compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, logs, and other framework-generated files.
-   `tests/`: Contains your automated tests.
    -   `Feature/`: Tests for a larger portion of your application's functionality.
    -   `Unit/`: Tests for a very small, isolated portion of your code.
-   `vendor/`: Contains your Composer dependencies.

## 3. Development Workflow & Testing

-   **Creating Functionality:** A common workflow for adding a feature is:
    1.  Define a route in `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php`.
    2.  Create a controller method in `app/Http/Controllers` to handle the route's logic.
    3.  Create a Blade view in `resources/views` to render the response (for web routes).
    4.  If needed, create an Eloquent model (`php artisan make:model`) and a database migration (`php artisan make:migration`).
-   **Running Migrations:** To run your database migrations, use `php artisan migrate`.
-   **Testing:** This project uses both **PHPUnit** and **Pest**.
    -   To run the entire test suite, use `./vendor/bin/phpunit` or `./vendor/bin/pest`.
    -   You can also use `php artisan test` for a more beautiful output.
    -   Always add tests for new functionality in the `tests/Feature` or `tests/Unit` directories.
