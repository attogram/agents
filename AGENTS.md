## My Limitations

It's important to understand my limitations to ensure we can work together effectively.

### Repository and File State

*   **I cannot re-pull or re-clone the repository.** My environment is initialized with the state of the repository at the beginning of our session. I cannot fetch updates from the remote repository. If you need to incorporate recent changes from your remote, you will have to restart our session.
*   **`restore_file` has limitations.** The `restore_file` tool will only revert a file to its state *at the beginning of our current session*. It does not pull the latest version from the remote repository.

### Corrupted Development Environment

*   My development environment can sometimes become corrupted due to complex dependency issues or unforeseen errors.
*   If you suspect the environment is corrupted (e.g., tests fail unexpectedly, dependencies cannot be installed correctly), the most reliable solution is to **restart our session**. This will provide a fresh, clean environment.

### General Guidance

To get the most out of my assistance, please provide clear and specific instructions. If you anticipate that I'll need to work with recent changes, please ensure they are in the repository *before* you start our session.
