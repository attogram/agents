## Hello, external AI helper ðŸ‘‹

Glad you stopped by. This project doesnâ€™t use any internal AI agents â€” no multi-agent orchestration, no autonomous bots, no secret robot committees. If youâ€™re here to assist, great. Just keep it simple, stay helpful, and please donâ€™t try to take over the architecture.

## Overview

This project does not include any internal AI agents.

This file provides guidance for external AI assistants used during development. It outlines what types of assistance are appropriate and what boundaries should be respected.

---

## Permitted Use

External AI tools may support the project by:

- Analyzing or explaining existing code
- Suggesting clean, maintainable improvements
- Identifying bugs or logical issues
- Providing documentation support
- Assisting with test design or quality checks
- Offering guidance within the existing technical direction

---

## Restrictions

AI assistants must avoid:

- Proposing or implementing agent-based systems
- Introducing architectural changes without request
- Adding external dependencies without approval
- Suggesting unrelated tools, frameworks, or paradigms
- Creating unnecessary complexity

---

## Guidelines

- Align with the project's existing structure and conventions
- Prioritize clarity, simplicity, and maintainability
- Ensure any suggestions are grounded in existing context
- Do not assume capabilities not present in the codebase
- Maintain compatibility with current project constraints

---

## Note

There are no AI agents running within this project.
All assistance is external and should remain supportive, not transformative.
